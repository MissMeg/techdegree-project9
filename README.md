## Project by: Megan Roberts
## Tech Dregree Track: Fullstack JavaScript
## Project Title: Create a Gallery App with React
## Project Requirements:
```
    1) Set up your project with create-react-app.
    2) Build your app components according to the provided mockup. Most components should be stateless functional components that focus on the UI rather than behavior. You’ll need:
        a) A container component that takes in a keyword and api key as props, and fetches the photos and other required information from the API
        b) A navigation menu component
        c) A component for each category you wish to display. For example, a Sunset component, a Flowers component, and a Clouds component.
    3) Update the CSS to style the app in a way that resembles the mockup.
    4) Install React Router and set up your and components.
    5) Get a Flickr API key
    6) Fetch the data from Flickr API. Make sure data fetching and state is managed by a higher-level “container” component. 
       We recommend using https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search. 
       Enter a tag to search for, such as “sunsets.” You may also want to limit the number of results using the per_page argument. 
       Choose JSON as the output, then “Do not sign call.” 
       Click “Call Method.” At the bottom of the page, you’ll see an example of the API call you’ll need to make. 
       You can click on the URL to see what the response will look like.
    7) Display the data. Make sure each image gets a unique "key" prop. There should be no console warnings regarding unique "key" props. The title of each image list should be displayed dynamically via "props".
    8) Add search field feature. The field should be visible only in the 'Search' route.
```
## Exceeds Expectations Requirements:
```
    1) Add a loading indicator that displays each time the app fetches new data.
    2) Include a 404-like error route that displays when a URL path does not match a route.
    3) If no matches are found by the search, include a message to tell the user there are no matches.
```
## Project Description:
In this project, you'll build an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. After creating the project with create-react-app, you will build the gallery components, write the CSS and set up routing.

I will be completing all requirements including the exceeds expectations.
